# PHYS 1B requires [MATH 10B, MATH 20B], among others. PHYS 2B requires [MATH
# 20B, MATH 20C, MATH 31BH], among others. PHYS 1C requires [PHYS 1B, PHYS 2B]
# and [MATH 10B, MATH 20B]. Is this redundant? Taking PHYS 2B does not imply you
# have credit for MATH 20B. MATH 20C implies MATH 20B, but MATH 31BH implies
# MATH 31AH, which doesn't imply anything. You could have credit for MATH 31BH
# and not meet the requirements for PHYS 1C. Is that a good thing?

# I'll just assume that *every* alternative is taken.
